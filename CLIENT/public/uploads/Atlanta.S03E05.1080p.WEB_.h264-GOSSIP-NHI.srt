And could you get rid of
all the ginger ale in there?

Why?

There's about f-four...
five rooms

Oh, man, they say this place
is, like, haunted.

There's a lot of creepy,
unexplained events.

Look, as long as it ain't
another Milwaukee,

that was a ghost I saw.

- No more European strip clubs,
all right, man?
- I heard that.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,355
It's 100 pounds to get in,

35
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,056
and, uh,
we don't have any titties.

36
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:44,694

- Sprinkle me.

Cool.

Oh, man,
can you get me a...

76
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:59,161
Yeah, there's a ginger beer
on stage.

77
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:01,030

You were saying you were feeling

78
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,032
"musty" on the way over here,
that means you're dehydrated.

more water, but, yeah,

00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:20,843
Whoo! Yeah!

108
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,013
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Hey!

109
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:27,850
Get the fuck off the stage.

110
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,786

- Start the show?
- Good luck.

115
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:16,999
I did not know you were poppin'
like that in Budapest.

116
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:20,169
Might have to add this stop
to the next tour.

117
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,336
What y'all looking for?

118
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,338
Just tried again.
Went to voice mail.

119
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:25,074
- Fucking phone?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,976
Man, we need
to hurry up and find this.

121
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:28,243
We still have
our map adventure to go on.

122
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,379
Hey, man, I got back from
my set, my shit was gone.

123
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,014
The one in the gold case?

124
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:33,883
When was the last time
you had it?

125
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,351
Man, it was out on the dock,
and then, uh...

126
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,421
I came back in for the meet
and greet with that cancer kid.

127
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,557
- And you didn't have it after?
- No, man.

128
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,194
No, man.

129
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,396
He wouldn't do that.

130
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,532
There was something weird
about that kid, man.

131
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:52,101
Uh, wait,
that dude is a fan, man.

132
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,036
Imagine if you had your
favorite celebrity phone.

133
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,938
Shit, man! Is he still here?

134
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:57,272
Hold on.

135
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:59,509
Yeah, does anybody
have eyes on the, uh,

136
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,511
VIPs from the meet and greet?

137
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,078
I think he's currently
being rushed

138
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:04,580
out of the building.

139
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,116
- Why?
- The paramedics were called in.

140
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:09,384
He said he was having
a cancer attack.

141
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,386
Cancer att... No.

142
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,188
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, man, wa--

143
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:15,190
I'm telling you,
if we just stick to...

144
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,359
- Not now, man, not now.
- Ah... damn.

145
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:20,896
Hey, hey!

146
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,699
- I need to talk to that kid.
- What?

147
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:24,900
No.

148
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:27,236
If it is for Paper Boi,

149
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,704
I want to help.

150
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:31,073
- Marvy, I don't think...
- Mom.

151
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,575
I need to do this.

152
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,310
What does Paper Boi need?

153
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,956
Um...

154
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,998
Hey.

155
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,433
- What are you doing?
- Get away from my son!

156
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,435
Boo!

157
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,606
Sorry. Thought he had a phone,
thought he had a phone.

158
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,977
Hey, you find him?

159
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,279
- He didn't take it.
- Man, how you know
he ain't take it?

160
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:13,515
- What you do? You just ask...
- Believe me, he didn't have it.

161
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,517
I could've told you
that boy didn't take that phone.

162
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,352
Nigga, you the one... Whatever.

163
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,254
Man, fuck, man.
I need that phone, Earn.

164
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:21,591
It's just a phone, man.

165
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:23,158
Look, I...

166
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,460
I can have a runner get one
in the morning for you.

167
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,029
Man, shit.

168
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:29,599
I know this is
a very memorial vibe,

169
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:31,667
but, uh, we can make
the whole situation

170
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,302
a little bit better
if we just...

171
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:35,304
Hey, look, it ain't even
about the phone, man.

172
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,039
It's about the shit
that's on the phone.

173
00:08:37,106 --> 00:08:40,009
- iCloud?
- No, we don't do iCloud.

174
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,444
No, yeah, exactly.
I'd have my shit backed up, too,

175
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:44,313
if it wasn't for
conspiracy Jones over here.

176
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,717
Who could've taken that phone?

177
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:52,021
What about that runner guy?

178
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:56,558
I think he was a runner, right?
That kid in the blue jacket?

179
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:59,128
The super unprofessional
stage manager.

180
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,031
That nigga that
was on the stage?

181
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:04,166
Oh, I thought that dude
was the caterer.

182
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:12,642
Oh, hey, buds.

183
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:16,011
Good gig.

184
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,647
You ready to settle up?

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,050
Yeah, Folk, soon. Um, can I talk
to that stage manager?

186
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,584
The stage manager?
He wasn't here today.

187
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,586
I was covering for him.

188
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:26,321
Then who was that guy?

189
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:28,658
What guy?

190
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:30,559
The guy who was...

191
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,195
He had crazy brown hair,
he was kind of young,

192
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:36,365
he was going around
asking people stuff...

193
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:37,599
He had a blue jacket.

194
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:44,106
- Oh, you talking about Wiley?
- Who?

195
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:45,741
Yeah, Wi--
Blue jacket, brown hair.

196
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,242
Yeah, Wiley. That's my nephew.

197
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,711
- Your nephew?
- Yeah.

198
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:52,381
He was here for a meeting
with the rigger about a job.

199
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:54,717
Okay, well, Al had his phone
stolen. We need to talk to him.

200
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:58,553
Really? That's very unfortunate.

201
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:00,289
You don't think
Wiley took it, do you?

202
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:02,091
Well, he was backstage
all night.

203
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,293
Eh... I'm sure
he didn't take it.

204
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,429
Well, I'm not saying he did,

205
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,732
I'm just saying
we'd like to talk to him.

206
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:10,866
Where is he?

207
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,235
I don't know.

208
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:17,406
Well... text him.
Can you text him?

209
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:19,742
I don't have his number.

210
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:21,443
You don't have
your nephew's phone number?

211
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,578
No.

212
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:27,249
I have his father's number, but
it is too late to call him now.

213
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:28,550
Well, it's an emergency.

214
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,253
An artist at your venue
had something stolen.

215
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:33,555
The rigger has his number.

216
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:34,824
I will get the number
from the rigger.

217
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,291
Okay, I'll come with you.

218
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,393
- What, you want it now?
- Yes.

219
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,849
Old boy doesn't even work here.

220
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:02,184
- Man, he don't work--
Then how the fuck...
- He's Folk's nephew.

221
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,820
He was here for an interview,
but he left.

222
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,822
This is his resume.
We got his info.

223
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,623
Man, call this fucker right now.

224
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:10,760
Hell yeah, and put that shit
on speakerphone, man.

225
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,267
- Shit.

226
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:21,804
Hello?

227
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:25,474
Hey, uh, is this Wiley?

228
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,842
Uh, as far as I know.

229
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:30,212
Hi, this is, uh, Earn,
Paper Boi's manager.

230
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,614
We spoke earlier today
at the show.

231
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,316
Show?

232
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:38,187
The-the Paper Boi concert.

233
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,456
Oh...
Uh, the rap presentation.

234
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,692
Yes. How can I help you?

235
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:44,960
Yeah, well, you disappeared.

236
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:47,496
Didn't you want
to meet Paper Boi?

237
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,966
Yeah, but he seemed, uh, busy.
Yeah, busy.

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,335
Well, he wanted to meet you.
We wanted to know if you,

239
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:55,404
you know, live near the venue.

240
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,475
You're, uh, you're calling
up fans randomly

241
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,244
to invite them to meet you.

242
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,479
- I feel like there's
an ulterior motive.
- No, no...

243
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:06,348
Listen, man, we're done
playing with you, yeah?

244
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:07,883
Do you know who you're
fucking with?

245
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:10,219
- Socks.
- Keep playing
with Team Paper Boi, yeah,

246
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:11,753
we're plugged in down here, man.

247
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,688
Mob shit. Yeah?

248
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:15,858
Like I'm the white
Liam Neeson, bruv.

249
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,727
I will track you down,
and I will fucking bury you

250
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,763
if you're not back here
in 15 minutes, phone in hand!

251
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,599
Bring the fucking phone back,

252
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,501
or we'll fucking kill you!

253
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:29,538
What is this? What the fuck
is wrong with you, nigga?

254
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,442
Hey, yo, man, hey.
What's going on, man?

255
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,010
It's Paper Boi right here.

256
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:37,847
We ain't gonna kill you, man.
We just, we just want to talk.

257
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,781
That man said
you were going to kill me.

258
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,017
Yeah, I know. I know, I know,

259
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:44,353
but he, uh, he was
just playing, man. Hey,

260
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,521
how about this, man, you-- if
you far-- Are you far from here?

261
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:48,357
Whatever. Hey, man,
come back to the venue,

262
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,025
I'll be here to meet you.
Call your uncle.

263
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:53,528
I swear it's legit, for real.

264
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:56,866
- Wiley?

265
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,902
- What the hell, Socks?
- Look, I'm sorry, man.

266
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,871
He's full of shit.
He's got that phone.

267
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:03,772
Yeah. We knew that,

268
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:05,774
but we need him
to come back here.

269
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,778
- White Liam Neeson?
- Like, what the fu--

270
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:11,646
That don't even make
no fucking sense, Socks, huh?

271
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:13,548
Are you thinking
of Samuel L. Jackson?

272
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:14,783
- Yeah, who are you
thinking about, man?
- What's wrong with you?

273
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:17,419
Fucking Liam Neeson's
already fucking white!

274
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:31,566
This is not how my night
was supposed to go, man.

275
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,935
Yeah.

276
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:34,970
Mine, either.

277
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,006
Yo, he came back.

278
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:39,274
Oh, shit.

279
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,019
- God!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

280
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:51,786
You stay out here, okay?

281
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,622
You too hot, all right?

282
00:13:53,622 --> 00:13:55,690
Uh, yeah.

283
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,493
Breathe.

284
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:00,595
Yeah, it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool.

285
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:06,301
Fuck!

286
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:10,639
H-Hello.

287
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,840
Hi.

288
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,981
How... how are you guys
enjoying Budapest?

289
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:21,016
Let's just get to the point.

290
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,618
You didn't happen to see a phone
while you were backstage

291
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,487
- all day, did you?
- What kind of phone, iPhone?

292
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,456
- Uh, Samsung?
- Doesn't matter...

293
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,824
Dawg, you find a phone or not?

294
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,561
No.

295
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,031
No, I didn't.

296
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,000
You know there's a "find
my phone" app that could--

297
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,369
- Yeah, that could help.
- No, no, no,
we don't use that.

298
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:42,537
That's how they track us,
you know better than that.

299
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,339
- Come on now.
- Ah.

300
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,912
Why were you backstage all day?

301
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:54,349
Oh, I was waiting
for my interview.

302
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,551
Then why'd you come back?

303
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,653
I thought about what you said.

304
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,591
I didn't want to miss
a chance to meet...

305
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,759
...Paper Boi.

306
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:08,430
I'm a long-time admirer of his.

307
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:14,769
Well, Paper Boi has
a really early flight tomorrow.

308
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:16,771
And if you know
where his phone is,

309
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,407
it'd be really helpful.

310
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,376
Is there something special
about this phone?

311
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,046
Is that why you said you were
going to kill me?

312
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,180
- What?

313
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,082
N-No, we didn't say that.

314
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:28,950
We... we're not gonna hurt you.

315
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,553
If I died today,
people will assume you did it,

316
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,055
I think.
They-the will.

317
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:34,889
Nobody's gonna die, Wiley.

318
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:37,759
We all have to die sometime.

319
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:40,795
You know that?

320
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,632
Maybe my end...

321
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,536
...should come
at the hands of Paper Boi.

322
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,576
This is funny.

323
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:57,212
Meeting you like this,
I feel like I'm dreaming.

324
00:15:57,246 --> 00:16:00,815
Trust me, ain't nobody
dreaming this, dawg.

325
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:06,655
What do you dream of?

326
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:11,560
Box-top Chevys?

327
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:15,764
Or kissing the thorn on a rose?

328
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:18,933
Oh, it's sweet, but it hurts.

329
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:24,573
It'd make you never want
to trust...

330
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:28,743
...anything too beautiful

331
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,945
again.

332
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,687
Out.

333
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:48,630
Listen, he's just scared.

334
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:50,632
He's only 19.

335
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:52,134
He's my nephew through marriage.

336
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,169
So, what happened--
did he admit to it?

337
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:57,206
- Not yet.
- Oh, damn it!
Piece of shit, man!

338
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:59,808
Fuck!

339
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,610
That was strange.

340
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:04,646
Have y'all noticed he's blinking
every five seconds on the dot?

341
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,182
What was that...
"box-top Chevy" shit?

342
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:09,184
I don't know, but I think

343
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,120
we might find out if we just go

344
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:12,821
to this one place on the map.
I'm telling you...

345
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,823
- We're not gonna do the map.
- I know.

346
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:16,691
That was my dream car
in high school.

347
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,560
Box-top Chevy.

348
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,063
And what about that rose thing?

349
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,966
You know, "nothing... trust
anything beautiful again"?

350
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,835
I used to date this girl
in high school.

351
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:29,538
My boy Pookie fucked her--
her name was Rose.

352
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:31,673
Yeah, Pookie stayed fucking her.

353
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:34,008
So...

354
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,178
how'd he know any of that?

355
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:38,813
I rapped about it
in some early shit.

356
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,183
Never released it, though.

357
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:44,186
It was on my phone.

358
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:49,724
Good cop?

359
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,693
Bad cop.

360
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:54,563
Devastated cop.

361
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:57,532
Oh, here they come. Okay.

362
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:05,006
I got you something.

363
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,008
Thank you.

364
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,910
You're welcome.

365
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:11,880
Listen, you're obviously a fan.

366
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,849
And sometimes fans get excited.

367
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,051
And, you know, it's possible

368
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,087
you just took the phone
by accident,

369
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,256
and maybe you're embarrassed
to tell us.

370
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,124
- And that's fine, that happens--
- You don't have the same accent,

371
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:25,860
you know, the same
southern dialect as Paper Boi.

372
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:29,598
- Uh...
- Were you told
as a child "you talk white"?

373
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,900
Sometimes.

374
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,102
Must've made you feel separate.

375
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,240
What does that have
to do with anything?

376
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,941
Nothing, nothing.

377
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:44,213
I think it's interesting
when people aren't allowed

378
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:46,248
in the group.

379
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:50,084
The universal group.

380
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,222
To be "part of the team."

381
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,958
You know,
people just want to be seen.

382
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:00,929
Doesn't matter what for.

383
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:02,797
Can I have a cigarette?

384
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,899
Sure.

385
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:08,737
Here.

386
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:12,106
Cool, cool.

387
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,648
Why do people smoke these?

388
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:21,816
Yep, I'm done.
I'm gonna beat you right now!

389
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,117
Wait, wait!

390
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:24,919
I want my one phone call.

391
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,955
This isn't jail, Wiley.

392
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,123
You can call anyone at any time.

393
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,792
Okay, um, I don't have a phone.

394
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:32,661
Could you, could you call
a number for me?

395
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:33,862
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,764
So it's, um, it's 404...

397
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,635
And that's my fucking number,
nigga! You got my fucking phone!

398
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,304
- Give me my fucking phone,

399
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:44,639
man, stop playing with me!

400
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:50,178
When I'm nervous, my stomach
churns-- it's disgusting.

401
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:52,213
I am sorry.

402
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:54,716
- Please don't hurt me.
- Oh!

403
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:58,853
Hey, he's just a scared kid.

404
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:01,122
You're interrogating
a 19-year-old.

405
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:03,325
I'm 32.

406
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:08,297
Nah!

407
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,968
That's not strange to you?

408
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,471
He's not 32, no way.

409
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,341
He's either 32
or he's lying about being 32.

410
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:22,210
Both is strange behavior.

411
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,878
Has it been so long?

412
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,480
I-I saw him maybe 15 years ago.

413
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:27,682
- That still doesn't make him 32.
- Wait, wait.

414
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:29,884
- 15 years?
- Mm.

415
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:31,486
This guy's a stranger to you.

416
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,187
You don't know him at all.

417
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,857
He's my nephew...
through marriage.

418
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:37,492
Okay, googled his address.

419
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:40,228
It's the fucking
Cirque du Soleil headquarters.

420
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,030
He's toying with us.

421
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:43,698
When was the last time
you actually saw him, man?

422
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:46,701
I visited him at juvenile
offenders institute.

423
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:48,370
So jail, kid jail.

424
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:49,938
Okay, so he's in on it,
isn't he?

425
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:51,340
Hey, hey, stop, man!
Chill out, man!

426
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:53,508
Go cool your ass off, bruh.

427
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,344
I'm so mad,
I could kill this ni...

428
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:58,046
Oh, I'm so mad, man.

429
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,752
He definitely stole it.

430
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:06,721
Mm-hmm, but we ain't got
no proof.

431
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,358
Well, he wants
to be close to you, so...

432
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:12,293
maybe just get him to confess
and we try and record it?

433
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,402
Socks almost said "nigga,"
right?

434
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:22,070
- He almost called us that.
- Yeah, I heard that.

435
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,979
Hey, Folk, man,
can I get you to, uh...?

436
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,824
Uh, so how much longer do you
think you will have me detained?

437
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:44,959
Ain't nobody detaining you, man.

438
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,261
Okay, I-I made you a crane.

439
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:55,770
Listen,
I know things haven't gone well.

440
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:58,473
And I want to do things
the right way.

441
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:01,342
I haven't been
completely honest,

442
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,412
which is why you guys,
you guys, uh,

443
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:05,179
you had to resort to this, uh,

444
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:06,981
you know, this good cop,
bad cop scenario.

445
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,518
Uh, at this point,
I think you're probably

446
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:11,986
gonna try to, uh, record me.

447
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,523
To get me to say something
incriminating, but, uh...

448
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,593
Look, I...

449
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:21,362
I don't think
you'll get what you want

450
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,832
that way.

451
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:31,473
Earn, let me talk to him, man.

452
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:33,542
Check on Folk.

453
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:01,570
You know, I haven't written
anything in about...

454
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:04,473
seven months.

455
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:08,009
Seven months, man, yeah.

456
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:11,412
Like, I go to the studio,
or I lay in bed,

457
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,482
and like... bah.

458
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:15,850
Like, nothing comes out.

459
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:17,852
I can't find the words.

460
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:20,054
It's like I don't know

461
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:22,524
what's bad or good anymore.

462
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:32,266
You know, I was never really
into rapping, either.

463
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,335
Not really.

464
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:36,337
Yeah, I know, like...

465
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,406
now it's what I do.

466
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:41,209
It's all I do, really.

467
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:45,113
And, you know, it's just, uh,

468
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,082
too late
for me to do anything else.

469
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:52,253
But tonight-- oh, man-- tonight
I was out there on the dock

470
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,288
before the show and, uh...

471
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:56,224
I finally heard it.

472
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,392
I finally heard him-- my voice.

473
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,895
I heard him, man,
loud and clear, like...

474
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,364
He was singing this melody, man.

475
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,466
He was singing this melody
like he was a kid on a bus.

476
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:07,569
And I started singing with him,
and it was....

477
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,904
it was...

478
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:15,910
It was fun.

479
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,549
And I recorded that
on the phone.

480
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,052
See what I'm saying, like...?

481
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,157
And if I don't...

482
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:32,293
If I don't...

483
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:34,395
get it back now, then, uh...

484
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:37,231
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose it.

485
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:39,568
Forever, so...

486
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,740
I need that phone.

487
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:48,109
Wiley, you know what I'm saying?
Like, I need that phone.

488
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:50,511
So...

489
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,614
did you take my phone?

490
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,354
Did you know we share
a birthday?

491
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:04,492
Hmm? April 28th.

492
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:06,294
We're Tauruses.

493
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:10,031
Thank you.

494
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,435
He texted me to...

495
00:25:20,474 --> 00:25:23,311
I like music, but I wasn't
really that into making it.

496
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:25,513
I was a lot like you.

497
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,449
Uh, then a girl broke my heart

498
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:30,484
in eighth grade--
her name was Rosie.

499
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:33,487
My mom moved me
and my sister to Budapest.

500
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:36,691
I was really, really, really

501
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:39,027
lonely.

502
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:42,631
But when I heard
The Postal Mixtape...

503
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,335
...I felt the same.

504
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,405
I didn't sympathize.

505
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:55,176
I didn't empathize.

506
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,578
I felt...

507
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:59,681
the-the same.

508
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:03,484
Um, so...

509
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:08,422
...I-I wrote this.
