This project uploads a file then sends it to the backend and is uploaded and displayed to the UI as an image and the name of the file.

Bootstrap used for the UI



To learn try and catch use
Event method (preventDefault) to prevent form from submitting before API call.
The package.json in the main folder runs the server and client using concurrently 
Express.js was used for creating the server 
Express App object methods used were for routing {
   post- used to send info to backend 
   listen - check for live server 

}
port 5000 was used
I dont understand fully how methods are used under routing yet
